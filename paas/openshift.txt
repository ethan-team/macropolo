ruby runtime key points:
1) create rhc project in different folder (not working folder)
   will leave origin remote to rhc
2) create github remote
   this is where to get updated code
3) precompile the asset and try to use passenger as webserver to see the result
4) clean up the precompiled asset
   41) rhc will compile the asset when application has been pushed
5) check in all updated file in master
6) git push - to push the master to origin (i.e. rhc)

useful commands:
 rhc domain show to list the application
 rhc tail app_name to see the log

info:
rhc is using Apache/2.2.17 (Unix) Phusion_Passenger/3.0.12
